# Real Time App

## Concept

Since the beginning of this subject, I wanted to create some sort of game. Therefore I started by searching for an API that would fit this. Sadly, I couldn't find an API that was going to satisfy my needs. With some guidance, I decided to choose the Giphy API to show a fun or sad GIF depending on if you won or lost. By doing this, I am still able to create a game as I wanted. Down here, you can see my sketches for three games. Eventually I chose to go for my last sketh: Higher or lower, since I can use the Deck of Cards API for this concept.
